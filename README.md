# PySFML - Python bindings for SFML

This is version **2.3.2** of the official Python bindings for **SFML**, based on SFML 2.3.2, and is made available under the terms of the **zlib/libpng** license.

    pip install pySFML

These bindings officially support Python 2.7 and the latest versions of Python 3.x but we encourage you to use the latter one. Incidentally, the documentation, tutorials and examples are written in the latest version of Python.

Please visit the website (https://www.python-sfml.org/) for any complementary information on this project. Also, feel free to email us with any questions or concerns.
